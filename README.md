# Interview Questions and Answers

This repository contains various technical interview questions, answers, and sample implementations.

## Node.js Topics

### Libuv Samples

The `node/libuv-samples/` directory contains comprehensive examples and demonstrations of how libuv works in Node.js. Libuv is the C library that provides the event loop and asynchronous I/O capabilities that make Node.js so powerful.

### What is Libuv?

Libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O operations. It was originally written for Node.js but is now used by other projects as well. Libuv provides:

- **Event Loop**: The core of Node.js's asynchronous behavior
- **Thread Pool**: For CPU-intensive operations
- **File System Operations**: Asynchronous file I/O
- **Network Operations**: TCP/UDP sockets, HTTP, etc.
- **Timers**: setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate
- **Process Management**: Child processes, signals

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `node/libuv-samples/` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the examples to understand libuv concepts

### Examples Available

- **Basic Event Loop**: Understanding the fundamental event loop phases
- **Async I/O Demo**: File system operations using libuv
- **Event Loop Phases**: Detailed demonstration of all event loop phases
- **Thread Pool Demo**: How libuv uses thread pools for certain operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tools to monitor libuv performance

### Key Concepts

- Event Loop Phases
- Microtask vs Macrotask Queues
- Thread Pool Usage
- Non-blocking I/O
- Performance Monitoring

## Other Topics

This repository will be expanded with more interview questions and technical examples covering various programming concepts, algorithms, and system design topics. The `node/` directory will contain Node.js-specific topics, while other directories will be added for different technologies and concepts.
